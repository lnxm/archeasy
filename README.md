arch installation script created by chatgpt just for me


This script will perform an automated installation of Arch Linux on your computer, with the following specifications:

Partitions: an EFI partition and a root partition (with no swap partition).
Latest low latency kernel will be installed.
Grub UEFI bootloader will be installed with Latitude E7440 compatibility.
Drivers for Latitude E7440 will be installed.
KDE will be installed without unnecessary bloat.
Brave browser, NetworkManager, Pamac, VLC, and Discord development edition (if available in AUR) will be installed.
Various tweaks will be made to improve performance and responsiveness, including optimizing the kernel.
neofetch will be installed and added to the terminal configuration.
British English will be the main language, and Czech QWERTZ will be the keyboard layout for both the terminal and KDE desktop.
Installation progress will be shown in the terminal prompt.
During the installation process, certain steps such as partitioning and formatting will be automated and run silently in the background, while others such as package installation will display a progress message in the terminal prompt.
